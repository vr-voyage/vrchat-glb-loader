# Still at its infancy. Can't do much by now

A Udon-ready GLTF Binary (GLB) loader.

[out-demo.webm](https://github.com/vr-voyage/vrchat-glb-loader/assets/84687350/001c47a1-278e-4bae-99f5-a0db48d7c3bc)

The point is to be able to load GLB data in-game.

For the moment it handles simple scenes.
Textures support is still unavailable, since I have
no idea how to convert PNG/JPEG data to Textures.

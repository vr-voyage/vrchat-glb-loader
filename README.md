# Still at its infancy

A Udon-ready GLTF Binary (GLB) loader.

[out-demo.webm](https://github.com/vr-voyage/vrchat-glb-loader/assets/84687350/001c47a1-278e-4bae-99f5-a0db48d7c3bc)

The point is to be able to load GLB data in-game.

For the moment it handles simple scenes.
Textures support is only available when encoding the
textures through a specific add-on, and is still added
in a very hacky (and probably broken way).

So it kind of works but... still meh.
